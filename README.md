**Pronouns:** he / him

I’m a Software Engineer from Puerto Rico currently based out of Chicago.  
I focus on building and operating **practical, production-like systems**, with an emphasis on Kubernetes, automation, and Linux infrastructure.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- Operating a **K3s homelab cluster** on mixed hardware  
- Automating cluster setup with **Ansible and Helm**  
- Experimenting with **Kubernetes networking and CNI behavior**  
- Running real workloads (game servers, services) on Kubernetes

## 💡 Engineering Approach

- Prefer **simple systems that I fully understand**  
- Automate repetitive and failure-prone tasks  
- Treat homelabs like production, not demos  

> Build it. Break it. Fix it. Automate it.
